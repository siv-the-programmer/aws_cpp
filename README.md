This repository is a **living knowledge base** for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** certification and broader AWS cloud fundamentals.

# EVERYTHING CAN BE FOUND IN THE STUDY_NOTES FOLDER

It documents my ongoing learning journey through:
- Core cloud computing concepts
- AWS cloud deployment models
- Fundamental benefits and characteristics of cloud computing
- Exam-aligned explanations grounded in real-world cloud usage

Content in this repository will **expand continuously** as I progress, refine my understanding, and add deeper AWS concepts.  
The emphasis is on **clarity, correctness, and long-term understanding**, not quick exam cramming.

This repository serves as:
- A structured study reference for AWS CCP
- A foundation for advanced AWS certifications
- A growing archive of cloud knowledge built incrementally

The goal is simple: build solid cloud fundamentals first, then scale.
