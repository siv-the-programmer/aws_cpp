Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is managed shared file storage.

# EFS characteristics:

File-level storage

Linux workloads

Multiple EC2 instances can mount simultaneously

Automatically scales

Regional and multi-AZ

# EFS vs EBS:

EBS = single instance disk

EFS = shared filesystem

# Common uses:

Shared web content

Content management systems

Shared application data

# Exam logic:
Multiple EC2 instances need shared access → EFS.
