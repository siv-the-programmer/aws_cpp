# Manual AMI creation is slow and error-prone.
# EC2 Image Builder exists to automate AMI creation and maintenance.

# Image Builder automates:

OS updates

Security patches

Software installation

Testing

AMI distribution

# Core components:

Image pipeline

Build components

Validation steps

Scheduling

# Why AWS built this:

Enterprises need consistent images

Security compliance requires repeatability

Manual processes do not scale

When to use Image Builder:

Regular AMI updates

Security-focused environments

Large fleets of EC2 instances

# Exam logic:
Manual AMI = possible

Automated AMI lifecycle = Image Builder
